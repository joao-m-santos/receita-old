# Tomato chili

<Ingredients>
- 700g ground beef
- 2/3 onions
- 2/3 cloves of garlic
- 1 can (400g) tomato pieces
- 1 can (400g) beans in tomato sauce (baked beans)
- 1 teaspoon cumin powder
- 1 tbsp paprika powder
</Ingredients>

1. Dice the onions and garlics and fry them with olive oil in a pan until golden.
2. Add the ground beef, squish it around the pan and season with salt and pepper. Let the bottom part cook and then mix it all together. Season with the cumin and paprika. Let the beef cook properly without lid.
3. After the beef is cooked, add the tomatos, followed by the beans. Mix well and let the sauces reduce, still without lid.
4. Serve with veggies and white rice.
5. (BONUS) For a Mexican twist, add some taco/burrito seasoning mix together with the other spices. Perfect for any Mexican carnitas dish!
