1. Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl. Knead with your hands for about 5-10 minutes. Leave it in the fridge at least for 2-3 hours.
2. Grab egg size pieces and make round shaped thin meat balls. Repeat this until you use all the mixture.
3. Cook them preferably over a barbecue, otherwise an electric grill or frying pan, until both sides get brown and the meat is cooked.
4. Serve with rice and veggies.
