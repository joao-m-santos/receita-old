# Quick chicken curry

(Based on Mom Gracinda's chicken curry)

<Ingredients>
- 800g boneless chicken thighs
- 1 courgette
- 2 onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 400ml coconut milk
- 3 tbsp curry powder
- 1 coriander
</Ingredients>

1. Cut the chicken thighs into small pieces and the courgette into blocks.
2. Dice the onions and garlics and fry them with olive oil in a pan until golden.
3. Add the chicken pieces to the pan, season with salt, pepper and the curry powder, and sear on all sides. Add the courgette blocks.
4. As the courgette starts to cook, start adding the coconut milk. Add it little by little, as to not drastically lower the pan's temperature. It should always be simmering. Add a dash of soy sauce and let it cook for about 10 minutes. Mix occasionally.
5. As the curry finishes, put a few leaves of coriander aside and fine-chop the rest. Add the chopped coriander to the pan and mix for about 1 minute.
6. If you want a thicker curry sauce, add a tablespoon of corn starch.
7. Turn off the heat, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Serve with white basmati rice and the leaves of coriander as garnish.
